# iot_wheelchair
This project implements an IOT based wheelchair prototype using the popular Arduino and Raspberry Pi.
The wheelchair could be controlled remotely using a web interface, the webpage also shows a live stream from the 
wheelchair using a raspi pi cam. The raspberry pi uses Node JS to impement the server and comminucates to the Arduino through USB.
The prototype is capable of detecting objects using ultrasonic or IR sensors to avoid unwanted mishaps.
